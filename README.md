## i18n-angular-nginx

A simple way to run an Angular application in localhost using a Docker container.

In this project, I share with you how to run an Nginx server and use it to redirect all requests for your application.

> This project has with application another project that I have been published on my GitHub. See it by this [link](https://github.com/rodolfodella/i18n-angular).

## Hands-on

1. clone this project or download it;
2. make sure that you have installed the Docker and docker-compose;
3. access the project directory;
4. run the command `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` to run in detached mode;
5. go to browser and type [http://localhost/i18n-angular/en/](http://localhost/i18n-angular/en/)
6. It's done. Enjoy!

> To stop the project running, use the command `docker-compose down`
